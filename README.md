## Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital world, real-time data processing is essential for informed decision-making. This project showcases the implementation of a Kafka-based data pipeline that collects real-time data from Wikimedia, processes it, and stores it in a MySQL database. The integration of Spring Boot, Kafka, and MySQL ensures efficient data flow and optimal performance.

## Environment

- Spring Boot Java 11
- Apache Kafka 2.x
- MySQL

## Project Structure

The project is structured with a parent module named `kafka-real-world` and two child modules, `kafka-producer` and `kafka-consumer`. This modular organization enhances code management and scalability.

## Modules

### kafka-producer

The `kafka-producer` module is responsible for reading real-time data from Wikimedia and producing Kafka messages. A dedicated service class handles data retrieval, packaging, and Kafka message publishing. The producer operates on a 10-minute refresh cycle to ensure up-to-date data ingestion.

### kafka-consumer

The `kafka-consumer` module consumes messages from the `wikimedia_recentchange` Kafka topic. The consumer efficiently processes incoming data and writes it to a MySQL database. To accommodate the large data size, the database table is altered to use the `TEXT` data type, preventing truncation errors.

## Real-Time Data Ingestion

The Kafka Producer module fetches real-time data from Wikimedia, transforming it into Kafka messages. This step ensures that our system stays synchronized with the latest changes from the source.

## Efficient Data Processing

The Kafka Consumer module efficiently processes incoming Kafka messages, enabling seamless data storage in the MySQL database. The architecture ensures data consistency and reliability.

## Database Table Alteration

To handle the substantial data size, the database table structure is altered to use the `TEXT` data type. This adjustment mitigates potential truncation errors and allows for smooth data storage.

## Setup and Configuration

The project requires a proper setup of Spring Boot, Kafka, and MySQL. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured correctly.

## Getting Started

To start using the Kafka Data Pipeline:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kafka-real-world.git`
2. Navigate to the respective modules: `cd kafka-producer` or `cd kafka-consumer`
3. Build and run the modules using Maven: `mvn spring-boot:run`

## Conclusion

The **Kafka Data Pipeline Implementation** project demonstrates the power of Spring Boot, Kafka, and MySQL in creating a robust and responsive system for real-time data processing. By following this README guide, you'll be able to set up, run, and explore the functionality of the Kafka-based data pipeline.
